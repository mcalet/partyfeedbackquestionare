# After Party Survey

The Idea of this PROJECT was to practice some of the most popular elements use for surveys.

HTML:
   - Some of the elements I use on this project: <select>/<option>, <input type="radio">, <fieldset>.
 	 - I also create a Contact information form where they must to complete to be able to submit the form.
 
 For CSS:
  - I use only one Image as a background and repeat it to create the illusion that the balloons are between the main box that contain the survey.
 	- For the main box I use some shadows to make it "pop" from the background and I also use some transparency so you could still see the background under the box.

Responsive website: The website resize and shrink depending on the size of the screen.
