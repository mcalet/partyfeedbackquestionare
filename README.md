# partyfeedbacksurvey

The Idea of this PROJECT was practice some of the most popular elements use for creating surveys.

Some of the elements I use on this project: <select>/<option>, <input type="radio">, <fieldset>.
 
 I also create a Contact information form where they must to compleate the information to be able to submit the form.
 
 For the stylesheet I use only one Image as a background and repeat it to create the ilussion that the balloons are between the main box that contain the survey.
 
 For the main box I use some shadows to make it "pop" from the background and I also use some transparency so you could still see the background under the box.
